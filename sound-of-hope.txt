# Sound of hope

The beautiful timbres of the morning
	so transparent and bright
	resonantly ringing
	awaken a hope

They carry me way on high
	on the hills
	to a vast, open
	open space
	where the wind plays a symphony
	to the horizon

		I cannot

		describe it

		by words

	but it sends my soul on journey
	through time and space

	towards the final victory

Freedom and Life
